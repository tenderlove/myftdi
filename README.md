# MyFTDI

A port of PyFTDI to Ruby.  All the bugs in this are mine, and it's very
experimental so use at your own risk!

I've only ever used this with the
[FT232H](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ft232h-breakout/overview), and I
don't really have any plans to test or support any other chips.  I just ported
this to Ruby because I like using Ruby.
